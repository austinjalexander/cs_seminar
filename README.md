#Initial Set Up!

1. In a browser tab, go to: `https://c9.io/`
2. Create a new, free account.
3. Create a new workspace (give it a cool name) and select _Custom_ as the type.
4. In the terminal, type: `sudo pip install pyzmq tornado scikit-learn`
5. In the terminal, type `sudo apt-get install python-pandas`

_Note: Steps 4 and 5 above are not ideal, but using_ `sudo` _and_ `apt-get` _is necessary due to the memory constraints of a free account at_ Cloud9. _Feel free to ask me more about this bit._
