#Initial Set Up!

1. In a browser tab, go to: <a href="https://c9.io/" target="_blank">c9.io</a>
2. Create a new, free account.
3. Create a new workspace (give it a cool name) and select _Custom_ as the type.
4. In the terminal: `sudo pip install pyzmq tornado scikit-learn`
5. In the terminal: `sudo pip install ipython --upgrade`
6. In the terminal: `sudo apt-get install python-pandas`
7. In the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/austinjalexander/cs_seminar.git`

_Note 1: Steps 4 and 5 above are not ideal, but using_ `sudo` _and_ `apt-get` _is necessary due to the memory constraints of a free account at_ Cloud9. _Feel free to ask me more about this bit._

_Note 2: From now on, instead of "in the terminal", I'll write_ `$`.


turn off Apache server: `$ lsof -i tcp:$PORT`
